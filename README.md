# OffSeason
This project was create with an intention to find affordable vacation spots that are currently low season, where prices drop and it is not to crowed for customers that enjoy more privacy. I had the chance to work on the front-end of this application where I have used Materialize, on the Pixabay API to get images and display them on the cards,  as well as the animations on-load page and on how the cards are being displayed.
We have used Hot Wire API to get best prices for hotels and weather API to display weather condition on every location.

What we have used to accomplish this project:
• Materialize
• Hot Wire API
• Weather API
